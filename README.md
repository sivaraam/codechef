## Codechef

A repository containing some codechef problem solutions. Also available in
the respective folders are the problem statements in the form of a PDF file.

Most of the programs should be standalone so Makefile's aren't written for them,
A `g++ solution.cpp` should do. The programs work well with a compiler that supports
C++14. It has been tested using a `g++` version 7.4.0-1ubuntu1~18.04.
